<h1>Ba I Yu - /bɑ ɑI jU/ or /bɑ ɪ jU/, but NEVER /bɑ i jU/</h1>
<h3>/I/ means /ij/ or /ɪj/ or /i/ or /ɪ/, and /U/ means /ʉː/ or /ʉw/</h3>
<h2>We made the game easier or harder, depending on who you ask</h2>
<p>Ba I Yu is a community-made levelpack managed by Three Layer Studios and developed mainly by SilverRush
    and amateurprocoal, with a HUGE chunk of levels from 13520. The levelpack consists of shrunken maingame levels, as well as some BONUS levels!
    Recently I have "re"joined the "main" development team, so expect more frequent updates from me!
