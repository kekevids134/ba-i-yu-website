<h1>Ba I Yu - /bɑ ɑij jʉː/ or /bɑ ɪ jʉː/, but NEVER /bɑ i jʉ/</h1>
<h2>We made the game easier or harder, depending on who you ask</h2>
<p>Ba I Yu is a community-made levelpack managed by Three Layer Studios and developed mainly by SilverRush
    and amateurprocoal. The levelpack consists of shrunken maingame levels, as well as some BONUS levels!
    Recently I have "re"joined the "main" development team, so expect more frequent updates from me!
