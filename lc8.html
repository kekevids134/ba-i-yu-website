<h1>How to beat LC8 from Antimatter Dimensions but it is very puzzling</h1>
<h2>This is a mod of Antimatter Dimensions. You can find the mod link in the AD Discord under #modification-releases and finding the forum.</h2>
<p>
At the start, keep your autobuyers as they normally are, until about 48 galaxies where you pause all your autobuyers (press A).<br/>

Get the next galaxy, then set your dimboost autobuyer to 1 second and turn off buy max. Manually get the first dimension boost, then press M once, and spam (not hold!) 5 until you get equal or just over the required next dimboost.<br/>

Repeat this until boosts = 2 * galaxies (mod 5), i.e. if your galaxies end in 0 or 5, get 5 or 10 boosts (or any number ending in 0 or 5), if it ends in 1 or 6, get 2 or 7 boosts, if it ends in 2 or 7, get 3 or 8 boosts, if it ends in 3 or 8, get 4 or 9 boosts.<br/>

If at any point you accidentally press M, SET 5TH DIM TO BUY SINGLES then turn on your dimboost autobuyer for one reset (5 boosts) by pressing A twice in quick succession. TURN IT OFF IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS. Then correct your boost amount.<br/>

When this is done, make sure your 5th dim is now set to BUY MAX. Press A (toggled on) again, and wait until your boosts are equal to twice your galaxies. At this point, press A (toggled off), hold M if needed, and get the next galaxy. EXPORT YOUR SAVE REGULARLY.<br/>

The challenge is completable at around 60 galaxies.
